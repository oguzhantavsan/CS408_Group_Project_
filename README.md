# CS408_Group_Project_

In this project, We developed a social networking application implementing
client and server modules. (i) The Server module manages message transfers, notifications
and friendship relationships among the users, and (ii) the Client module behaves as a user
which adds/removes friends, accepts/rejects friendship requests, sends/receives messages and
receives relevant notifications.
